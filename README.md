**Project Title: Sonar Data Classification**

**Description:**
This project involves the classification of sonar data into two categories: "Rock" and "Mine." The sonar data consists of readings from different sonar frequencies and angles, collected using a sonar sensor. The goal is to train a machine learning model to accurately classify the sonar signals as either rocks or mines based on the input features.

**Files Included:**
1. `sonar_data.csv`: CSV file containing the sonar data. Each row represents a sonar signal, and each column represents a specific feature of the signal.
2. `sonar_classification.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the code for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
3. `README.md`: Documentation file providing information about the project, including its description, files included, and instructions for running the code.

**Dependencies:**
- Python 3.x
- pandas
- scikit-learn

**Instructions for Running the Code:**
1. Install Python 3.x if not already installed.
2. Install the required dependencies using the following commands:
   ```
   pip install pandas scikit-learn
   ```
3. Download or clone the project repository from GitHub.
4. Navigate to the project directory.
5. Open and run the `sonar_classification.ipynb` Jupyter Notebook.
6. Follow the instructions provided in the notebook to execute the code cells.
7. The notebook contains sections for data loading, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and prediction.

**Results:**
- The trained logistic regression model achieved an accuracy of approximately 85.56% on the training data and 71.43% on the testing data.
- A sample input signal was provided to the model for prediction, resulting in the classification of the signal as a "Mine."

**Future Improvements:**
- Experiment with different machine learning algorithms (e.g., decision trees, random forests, neural networks) to potentially improve classification accuracy.
- Perform more in-depth feature engineering to extract more relevant information from the sonar data.
- Explore techniques for hyperparameter tuning to optimize the performance of the models.
